# DJS03 Project Brief: Book Connect - Abstractions

I had to refractor the exisiting goal by implementing abstraction to enhance functionality.

#### Goals

- **Refactor Existing Code**: Analyse and refactor the given JavaScript and HTML code to improve its structure using objects and functions.
- **Implement Abstraction**: Use abstraction to hide the complex reality while exposing only the necessary parts. This involves creating more generic functions that can perform tasks in a more flexible way.
- **Documentation**: Write clear comments and documentation for the new code structure to explain the purpose and functionality of code blocks, functions, and objects.
- **Follow Styleguides**: Adhere to established coding conventions and Styleguides to ensure code readability and maintainability.

#### Tasks

1. **Code Analysis**: Start by understanding the current implementation of the "Book Connect" application, including its HTML structure and JavaScript functionality.
2. **Plan Refactoring**: Identify sections of the code that can be made more abstract and modular. Look for patterns and repetitive code that can be simplified.
3. **Implement Abstraction**:
   - **Objects**: Define objects to represent key elements of the application, such as books, authors, and genres. Utilise the provided data (e.g., `authors`, `genres`, `books`) to populate these objects.
   - **Functions**: Create functions that handle repetitive tasks, such as rendering the book list, handling user interactions, and applying filters.
4. **Enhance Functionality**: Ensure that the application remains fully functional after refactoring. Test all features to confirm that users can still search, filter, and view books as intended.
5. **Documentation and Comments**: Throughout the refactoring process, document your code. Provide comments that explain the purpose and functionality of objects and functions.
6. **Adherence to Styleguides**: Ensure your code follows JavaScript and HTML coding standards and best practices for readability and maintainability.
